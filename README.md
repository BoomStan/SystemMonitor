 # System Monitor #
Overview

This project is a lightweight system monitor developed as part of an effort to learn how C++ works. It aims to display essential system information without including GPU details or CPU temperature, offering a basic and clean interface to track key system performance metrics.

Key Features:

   CPU Usage: Displays the current usage percentage of each CPU core.
   Memory Usage: Shows total, used, and available memory (RAM).
   Disk Usage: Monitors disk space for system partitions.
   Network Statistics: Provides network bandwidth information, including current upload and download speeds.
   System Uptime: Tracks how long the system has been running.
   Operating System Info: Displays the OS name, version, and architecture.

This project is intended to explore and understand core C++ concepts, focusing on building a practical and functional system tool.
